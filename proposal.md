# Jeopordy Proposal
## What is Jeapordy?
Jeapordy is a famous trivia game show in which players win or lose specified amounts of money depending on the amount assigned to a certain question.
If they answer the question correctly, they gain the money, and if they answer incorrectly, they lose that amount of money.

I want to create this game because it is a game I've grown up watching with my family and I think it would be a lot of fun to re-create it.

## Initial thoughts on game structure
The challenges I expect to encounter are probably going to be all logic-based, as that is still the area I am the most uncomfortable with. 
Creating the functions and linking everything together so that it actually works will almost certainly be the thing that takes up most of my time.
I would love to create an introduction to the game with the theme song playing and then create some kind of animation that displays the categories and money values one by one like it does in the show.

## Phases of Completion
The first step will be to create all the basic HTML and styling for the main page. Next, I want to create the basic functionality that allows you to click on a value, 
view the question connected to that value, and answer it with multiple choice options. When the answer is correct, that value is added to your bank, and if it is incorrect, it is subtracted. The game is over when all the questions have been answered. 
If you have money in the bank at the end, you win, and if you have no money or a negative balance, you lose. After having this basic functionality, I can start to add things like my game sounds, animations, daily doubles, and possibly an option where you can play against the computer.
